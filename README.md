# App DWR land and water use visualization

This repository contains the code and file for the Shiny web app in the website 

The .csv file contains the data from the original source DWR's land and water use estimates: https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Water-Use-And-Efficiency/Land-And-Water-Use/Agricultural-Land-And-Water-Use-Estimates

**To update the app only is necessary to put in the .csv file the latest data posted by DWR. Remember that this data set is at a county scale.**
